## About the Collection

This digital collection shows how Hurricane Donna changed Collier County not only through destruction, but also by creating unity and resilience in the aftermath. Every image and record in the collection contributes to reconstructing the narrative of that September of 1960, when a whole community had to deal with grief, uncertainty, and the long process of recovery.
The flooded homes and neighborhoods show how Donna’s storm surge swallowed familiar streets and left families displaced. Yet, beyond the wreckage, there is an unmistakable sense of endurance. These images speak to how people adapted quickly, helping one another in the aftermath of a disaster that reshaped the entire county. The storm revealed how vulnerable Collier County was, but also how strong it could become when faced with crisis.
This resilience is echoed in the official reports and public health records that followed. The Collier County Civil Defense Report documents not just the chaos, but the organized local response led by figures such as Sheriff E.A. Doug Hendry, whose leadership symbolized calm and coordination in a time of fear. The Florida Health Notes issues take that story further, turning local experience into statewide learning. By analyzing the storm’s health and sanitation effects, they reflect how communities used disaster as a catalyst for growth  improving preparedness, communication, and care.
The headline regarding federal disaster help in the newspaper conveys more than just news; it depicts a moment when local resiliency met national acknowledgment. Following months of seclusion and uncertainty, Collier County's recovery became a part of a broader narrative about Florida's reconstruction.
When taken as a whole, these resources provide a cohesive narrative of how a tiny Gulf Coast town confronted the force of nature, reacted bravely and together came out stronger. In the end, Hurricane Donna in Collier County is a tale of remembrance and rebirth that retains not just the harm caused but also the tenacity required to overcome it.
